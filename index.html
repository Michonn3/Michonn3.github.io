        <p>
            My name is Michelle Navarro. I am 24 years old. I have a bachelors in Computer Science. I currently teach AP Computer Science Principles to high school students. 
            I have a six year old son, Alexis. In my free time I enjoy pursuing new activities such as: going to the gun range, coding, fishing, riding motorcycles, playing basketball
            or tennis.
